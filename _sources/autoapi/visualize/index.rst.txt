.. py:function:: plot_images_two_rows(top: Iterable[numpy.ndarray], bottom: Iterable[numpy.ndarray], row_size: int = 10, figure_size=(20, 4)) -> None

   Plot a top-row of images, alongside a bottom-row of images.

   :param top: the images on the top-row. There must be at least :code:row_size: elements.
   :param bottom: the images on the bottom-row. There must be at least :code:row_size: elements.
   :param row_size: the maximum number of images on a row.
   :param figure_size: the size of figure in inches, as passed to :func:`plt.figure`.


.. py:function:: plot_reconstruction_on_first_batch(loader: torch.utils.data.DataLoader, model_reconstructing: torch.nn.Module) -> None

   Plots the first batch of reconstructed images against the original images.

   :param loader: a loader from which the first batch of images is loaded.
   :param model_reconstructing: a model which reconstructs an image (produces an image of identical structure to
                                the input image, when passed an input-image).
